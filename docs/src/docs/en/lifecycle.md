It should be noted that the installed will be executed during the instantiation, which is not shown above. For example, it'll executed when a component is removed and restored, or when the new component is being added.

### Examples

```js
class Timer extends Omi.Component {
    constructor(data) {
        super(data);
    }

    install () {
        this.data = {secondsElapsed: 0};
    }

    tick() {
        this.data.secondsElapsed++;
        this.update();
    }

    installed(){
        this.interval = setInterval(() => this.tick(), 1000);
    }

    uninstall() {
        clearInterval(this.interval);
    }


    style () {
        return `
        .num { color:red; }
        `;
    }

    render () {
        return `<div>Seconds Elapsed:<span class="num"> {{secondsElapsed}}</span></div>`;
    }
}
```
